This is a native prototype of a website for Women in Sports, or WISP. 
WISP aims to empower women in sports by giving women who play sports professionally more recognition.

About Page - A page that describes WISP's mision and vision and also contains contact info
Login Page - A page that allows a user to login to their account
Registration Page - A page that allows a user to create an account

Because we cannot use existing teams in our prototype due to potential copyright issues, we created our own six teams:
Wispies, Sunnies, Ballers, Ladyz, Flyers, and Stars

These teams theoretically play all sports, and all of these teams have the same player, Jane Doe.
This is only for prototyping purposes. The actual website would have different teams for each sport and have multiple players playing for each team.

This prototype was created for Hack Like W@CC: Sports Track
